# eBPF on MacOS - Actually on Lima

If you've never heard of [Lima](https://lima-vm.io/), it allows one to spawn virtual machines on MacOS.

I find it pretty convenient, so I decided to show you how to run eBPF code with it. Or even better, give you the fully fledged eBPF development environment.

All you have to on your Mac, is run:

```
limactl create --name=default default.yaml
```
